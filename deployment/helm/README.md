# Helm charts

Helm is the deployment engine for everything the demonstrator installs (TDR ADR 001). Each chart
documents its values in its own README.

| Chart | Path | Status | README |
|---|---|---|---|
| BDD pool | `deployment/helm/bdd-pool` | in use (kind and IONOS) | [bdd-pool/README.md](bdd-pool/README.md) |
| Admission provider | `deployment/helm/admission` | new; installed after Gatekeeper | [admission/README.md](admission/README.md) |
| Admission pool | `deployment/helm/admission-pool` | new; admission-proof namespaces and tester identity | [admission-pool/README.md](admission-pool/README.md) |
| Lifecycle fixture (test data, never released) | `features/fixtures/charts/lifecycle-fixture` | in use by the acceptance scenarios | [README](../../features/fixtures/charts/lifecycle-fixture/README.md) |
| ORCE | — | planned; until then ORCE is installed from `deployment/orce-minimal/` | — |
| Umbrella chart for a zone | — | planned: management and data planes in separate namespaces, baseline deny network policies, workload identity before any workload | — |

## Quality gate

Every pull request lints and renders every chart under `deployment/helm/` and
`features/fixtures/charts/` with Helm v4.3.0 (the `charts` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`); a
chart whose values have no defaults is checked with its `ci/values.yaml`. The lifecycle workflow
itself runs a server-side dry-run before every install (`scripts/lifecycle.sh`). A server-side
dry-run as a CI gate before a release is promoted (TDR-BDD-11) is not in place yet; that row is
pending in the [catalogue](../../docs/bdd-catalogue.md).

```bash
for chart in deployment/helm/*/ features/fixtures/charts/*/; do
  values=(); [ -f "$chart/ci/values.yaml" ] && values=(-f "$chart/ci/values.yaml")
  helm lint "$chart" "${values[@]}" && helm template "$chart" "${values[@]}" >/dev/null
done
```
